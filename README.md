# Falmes of Passion - The FLAMES Game
### Designed by Koi

## Description
This correctly incorrectly spelled repository is a flames game about seeing if two people are meant to be together. Total bogus concpet btw, but it's a project I can make right now so...


## Installation & Usage
I actually DON'T want you to use this project. I don't think it's very good.


If you DO want to use it, here's how you can do that:


Note: This guide is for Windows operating system only


You will need to have python 3 installed on your local machine to run the program. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install
- After you have downloaded python and set it up, download the flames.py file.

- From there, go to where you downloaded the file to and right click the file to open more options.

- Look for an option to "Copy as path" and select it.

- Once you have copied the path, go to the search bar and search for "Terminal". Open it.

- In your terminal, enter the command "py" in the terminal line. 

- Once you type in py, paste in the file location you copied earlier wtih Ctrl+V. Press enter to run the program

Usage
- Once the program is running, you will be able to play the flames game! Enter your name in the top box and someone else's name in the bottom box.

- After you have entered your names, press the 'SHOW RESULTS' button and see what you get!

- You can play it as many times as you want, but the label section will eventually fill up and you may not see your results, so to fix, close out the program and restart it as stated below.


To replay the game, simply type in the py command with the file path and press enter again, and a new window will display.
